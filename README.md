Here are the details of the code challenge. Your code must compile in Visual Studio 2019 or above and the reviewer should be able to test it easily. 

Write a small user-friendly web site that allows the user to type a URL into an input box and then do the following:

List all images from the target URL and show them to the user in a carousel or gallery control of some kind .
Count all the words (display the total) and display the top 10 occurring words and their count (either as a table or chart of some kind) 

There is a lot of room within this brief to demonstrate strengths with some creative coding.

Code quality and non-functional aspects are more important than creating a visually impressive solution. When evaluating, we'll probably spend about 5 minutes playing with your app as an end-user and 1 hour dissecting every line of code. 

Candidates that do well on this test generally impress us by doing more than the bare minimum and focusing on multiple non-functional areas (examples only):

Method of delivering or displaying the program to us
Choice of tools, frameworks & 3rd party components
Consideration for Security, Performance, Maintainability, Re-usability, etc.
 

Evaluation will also take into consideration the role being applied for. e.g., a Frontend developer might choose to focus on page weight, perceived response time, ADA compliance, etc. An Architect might choose to focus on TTFB, caching strategies, connection handling, etc

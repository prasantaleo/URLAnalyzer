Here are the details of the XCentium code challenge. To be completed at your leisure, preferably before Monday, Mar 31st. I suggest you timebox it to no more than 4 hours. Your code must compile in Visual Studio 2019 or above and the reviewer should be able to test it easily.

 

Write a small user-friendly web site that allows the user to type a URL into an input box and then do the following:

List all images from the target URL and show them to the user in a carousel or gallery control of some kind (borrow from the internet or write your own).
Count all the words (display the total) and display the top 10 occurring words and their count (either as a table or chart of some kind, again you choose or write your own)
 

There is a lot of room within this brief to demonstrate strengths with some creative coding.

Code quality and non-functional aspects are more important than creating a visually impressive solution. When evaluating, we'll probably spend about 5 minutes playing with your app as an end-user and 1 hour dissecting every line of code.

 

Candidates that do well on this test generally impress us by doing more than the bare minimum and focusing on multiple non-functional areas (examples only):

Method of delivering or displaying the program to us
Choice of tools, frameworks & 3rd party components
Consideration for Security, Performance, Maintainability, Re-usability, etc.
 

Evaluation will also take into consideration the role being applied for. e.g., a Frontend developer might choose to focus on page weight, perceived response time, ADA compliance, etc. An Architect might choose to focus on TTFB, caching strategies, connection handling, etc.

You may optionally include a short description highlighting the areas of the program that you think are unique/important and justifications for the choices you have made.

 

If you have any questions or if the due date will be an issue, please let us know. If you are sharing code on Github, make sure it is a public repository.
